I **cant' stand** how Markdown implements emphasis. Why, since this was clearly deducted from writing in news boards, couldn't those concepts be used? Which were, a simple asterisk used for **bold** and a slash for _italic_? Underscores were for underlines. All makes sense. _What are the **reasons**?_
