- No one taught me how to write a list
- in Markdown
- What kind of silly exercise is this?

Oh, I see now.

1. Read the exercise
2. If something seems amiss, read the description again
   * Make sure you read it all
   * also the hidden parts via expanding sub-blocks
3. Then complete the exercise.
